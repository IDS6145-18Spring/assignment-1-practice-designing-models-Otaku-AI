I implemented the agent class and its 3 main subclasses: vehicle pedestrian and leisure.

The [**Agent class**] (agent.py) has the general functionality for an agent such as sending and receiving messages and having plans and priorities that the system assigns.

The [**vehicle class**] (Vehicle.py) has the basic functionality to allow cars to give and accept new directions.

The [**pedestrian class**](Pedestrian.py) implements pedestrians personality and motivation and current plans and allows querying into the system.

The [**leisure class**](leisure.py) provides the basic functionality to allow a leisure agent to advertise and use the system to their businesses advantag
