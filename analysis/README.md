## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

I would use mostly agent modelling though the interactive dynamic bayesian model could be classified as both discrete and agent since it has components of both. 

Since Im using approaches from multiagent systems agent based modelling would make the most sense for each type of agent.

I need a simulation method robust enough to allow accurate strucutal learning for the IDIDs. A game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine would be useful for this. This would work by having an initial IDID and having each type of agent act autonomously according to their defined function. The information from the IDID for things like navigation would be communicated to each agent and the results on congestion in the simulation could be analyzed. This data can be used to learn a better structure and parameters. Once this is done the agent behavior can be accentuated with the OCEAN model that would allow potential issues in certain personality types working properly with the results of the IDID which could learn specific models for different types of people.
